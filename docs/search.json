    "text": "About me\nI am an experimental evolutionary ecologist who studies how ecosystem context impacts the ecology and evolution of species interactions. I am interested in quantifying how environmental context (e.g., food web structure, resource quality) modifies species interactions to gain a better understanding of the mechanisms that maintain biodiversity and influence community dynamics.\nMy research primarily uses use lab-based experiments to quantify species interactions, assay traits, and conduct experimental evolution. I primarily work with aquatic microorganisms, specifically protists and microzooplankton, specializing in continuous culturing methods (i.e., chemostats).\n\n\n\n\nI am currently a postdoctoral researcher in the Biotic Responses to Environmental Change at the University of Zurich led by Dr. Frank Pennekamp.\nIn January 2025 I will join Dr. Emanuel Fronhofer’s group at the Institut des Sciences de l’Evolution (ISEM) of the CNRS and the University of Montpellier as an SNF Postdoc.Mobility Fellow.\n\n \nThis website is currently a work in progress.
